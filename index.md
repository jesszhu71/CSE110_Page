# Introduction to Self

### Personal Info

![profile_pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43154527/230321557-555d40a3-8408-4a39-9c04-b106ac96d122.jpg)

I am from **San Jose**, born and raised. 

> I am currently a third-year majoring in **Computer Science**. I transferred from UCSC fall of this year, and I am class of 2024. 

```
I got into computer science from a summer program Girls Who Code junior year of high school. Before that I 
had never done any coding more complex than writing a Scratch program, but I had always enjoyed math and 
science classes over the liberal arts classes. Then I decided this is what I was going to study in 
college, and so now I am here :) 
```
As someone who _isn't_ familiar with the San Diego area (and SoCal in general), I enjoy taking walkings and 
taking [public transportation](https://www.sdmts.com/) to explore new areas and trying 
new foods. I also like taking photos. Below is a collection of some recent finds.
